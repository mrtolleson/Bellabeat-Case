#Bellabeat Case Study Description

This repository exists to fulfil the capstone project requirement of the Google Data Analytics certificate course through Coursera.

Others who have published results to this project included analyses that were mostly correlations and scatterplots. In my report, I focused more on the business task of, "How can I help this company develop a successful marketing campaign?"

In that spirit, I didn't do any correlations like minutes of activity on minutes sleep per night. Instead, I focused on which features were actually used by fitness tracking device consumers. In addition, I used frequency distributions to describe different types of consumers and infer what might be an attractive feature for them.

In a different project with a different purpose, I might be more curious about the effects of different activities on sleep or calories consumed.

Enjoy!
